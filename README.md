# Contacts App using react!
A demo application to get familiarised with application development using React library. As the first step a very basic boiler plate is created here. Next, continuous integration is setup using Travis CI, deploying the application to firebase.
 
URL: https://react-contacts-ind.firebaseapp.com/

A ContactList component is added, loading data from a local JSON file.

To run the application in your local system
1. Clone/download the source code
2. Run ***npm install*** to install the node packages
3. Run ***npm start*** to start the application
